# Device-Agnostic Master Page (DAMP) Word Theme

This is a WordPress variant of the Device-Agnostic Master Page (DAMP) Template.
I found the DAMP Template to be the leanest version of the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) to date. It was designed from the ground up with enhanced code readability and responsive functionality in mind.

## Info
* Note that the DAMP Word Theme will have the same template issues as the DAMP Template. i.e. W3 Validator throws an error about the following line: <pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1" /&gt;</code></pre> but this is legitimate code from HTML5 Boilerplate.

* This theme includes custom taxonomies suited specifically for the client: The Dept of Finance Canada. A more generic platform can be made if there is enough interest.
* This theme requires a choice of mandatory plug-ins to be fully standards compliant.
> If you're going to use open-source, you should support the open-source community! Plug-in usage is encouraged, _with reason_ ofcourse.
* The Theme uses No Half Pixel's Theme Options Framework to add a Theme Options page.
