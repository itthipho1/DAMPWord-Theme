# Device-Agnostic Master Page (DAMP) Word Theme

This is a WordPress variant of the Device-Agnostic Master Page (DAMP) Template.
We found the DAMP Template to be the leanest version of the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) to date. It was designed from the ground up with enhanced code readability and responsive functionality in mind. We hope to add client customization by way of the WordPress control panels.

## Info
* Note that the DAMP Word Theme will have the same template issues as the DAMP Template. i.e. W3 Validator throws an error about the following line: <pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1" /&gt;</code></pre> but this is legitimate code from HTML5 Boilerplate.

* This theme includes custom taxonomy suited specifically for the client: The Dept of Finance Canada.
* It requires a choice of mandatory plug-ins to be fully standards compliant.
